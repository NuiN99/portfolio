    "full1": "I'm a game developer located in Victoria, BC with a diploma in Interactive Media Development from Camosun College. I also worked at KIXEYE for a year as a game programmer on a live service mobile game, fixing bugs and implementing features for millions of users. I'm currently directing and programming my own online multiplayer game, BeetleBall, as well as using my skills to help others in creating their own dream multiplayer games!",
    "full2": "I especially love online games because of the emergent possibilities that can arise from different people interacting with each other, and the chaos that can arise. The prototype version of my current game, BeetleBall, was created during a game jam, and it only took three days to develop an silly idea into a fully functional 6v6 online multiplayer game."
